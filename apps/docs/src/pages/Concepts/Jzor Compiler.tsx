## Jzor Compiler

The Jzor Compiler, envisioned as a standalone command-line tool, is set to be released in the future. 
Its primary function will be to enhance diagnostics and streamline the packaging process of applications into a single, distributable file, optimized for deployment on a Jzor Host.

Targeted towards more complex scenarios and build server integrations, the Jzor Compiler is designed with advanced usage in mind, particularly suitable for larger development teams. 
Reflecting its specialized nature and the value it brings to more complex development environments, there might be a fee associated with this feature.
