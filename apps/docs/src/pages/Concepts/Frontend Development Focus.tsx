## Frontend Development Focus

Jzor distinguishes itself by specializing in frontend development within the .NET ecosystem, offering unique tools tailored for this purpose. While it features a built-in TypeScript compiler and supports a React-like development experience, Jzor's approach is specifically designed to enhance the frontend development process, making it a distinct choice for developers working with .NET.

### Core Aspects of Jzor

- **Specialized for Frontend**: Unlike Node.js, which serves a broader scope including server-side development, Jzor is more focused on providing frontend developers with a comprehensive set of tools and frameworks that integrate smoothly with the .NET backend.

- **Integrated TypeScript Compiler**: Although Jzor includes a TypeScript compiler, it doesn't eliminate the need for other development tools and processes. The compiler streamlines the workflow by allowing direct compilation within the Jzor environment, yet developers may still utilize additional tools for testing, bundling, and optimization.

- **React-like Framework**: Offering a framework with a React-like syntax and lifecycle, Jzor aims to provide a familiar and efficient environment for developers to create dynamic and responsive UIs, enhancing the development experience for those already accustomed to React and other modern JavaScript libraries.

- **Customization and Extensibility**: With its emphasis on frontend development, Jzor still upholds principles of customization and extensibility. Developers can adjust the core features or expand capabilities through plugins, ensuring the platform can be tailored to various project requirements.

- **Plugin-Powered Development**: Jzor facilitates frontend development by offering a range of plugins. This approach speeds up prototyping and development, enabling developers to leverage existing solutions without deep dives into backend complexities.

- **Integration with .NET**: While Jzor streamlines frontend development, it also maintains seamless integration with C# and the .NET backend. This ensures that more intricate backend logic can be efficiently connected with the frontend, providing a cohesive development experience.

Jzor's emphasis on frontend development within the .NET ecosystem positions it as a unique tool for developers seeking to enhance their workflow and productivity. By offering a specialized platform that marries the ease of frontend development with the power of .NET, Jzor helps bridge the gap between frontend and backend development, fostering more collaborative and integrated project environments.
